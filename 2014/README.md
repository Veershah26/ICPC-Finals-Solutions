The Great Cardoni, Master Prestidigitator, has a deck of 21 numbered cards which he uses in a trick as
follows:
            A spectator secretly selects a number between 1 and 21, inclusive, after which Cardoni
            deals the 21 cards, face-up, row by row in order from 1 to 21, into a 3-column grid. The
            spectator then indicates which of the three columns contains the selected card, at which
            point the magician picks up the cards by columns, picking up the specified column second
            (the order of collecting the other two columns is unimportant). Cards are collected face up,
            beginning with the top card in each column and placing each succeeding card immediately
            beneath the previously collected card. The cards are then redealt by rows into a 3-column
            grid, starting from the top of the face-up deck. The process is repeated two more times;
            each time, the column indicated by the spectator is the second column picked up by the
            magician. After three such iterations, Cardoni announces, "I have penetrated to the heart of
            your mind; your card lies at the heart of this display." And it's trueâ€”the selected card is
            located at the "heart" of the array (row four, column two). Moreover, the selected card will
            always remain in this stable location for any further iterations of the column indication and
            card redealing process.
